# Heroes of Pymoli

## Background

This repository, I was tasked with a Python Pandas project where I could learn how to apply it to new situations. 

### Pre Project Prep

1. Created a new repository for this project called `pandas-challenge`.

2. Cloned the new repository to my computer.

3. Inside my local git repository, created a directory named **HeroesOfPymoli**.

4. Added a Jupyter notebook to this folder.
