# Heroes of Pymoli

## Background

This repository, I was tasked with a Python Pandas project where I could learn how to apply it to new situations. 

### Pre Project Prep

1. Created a new repository for this project called `pandas-challenge`.

2. Cloned the new repository to my computer.

3. Inside my local git repository, created a directory named **HeroesOfPymoli**.

4. Added a Jupyter notebook to this folder.

## Heroes of Pymoli

In this scenario, I landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. I was assigned the task of analyzing the data for a hypothetical fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, I was instructed to generate a report that broke down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

My final report includes the following:
### Player Count

* Total Number of Players

### Purchasing Analysis (Total)

* Number of Unique Items
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Number of Purchases
* Total Revenue

### Gender Demographics

* Percentage and Count of Male Players
* Percentage and Count of Female Players
* Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

* The below each broken by gender
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price

  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group

### Top Spenders

* Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):
  * SN
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value

### Most Popular Items

* Identify the 5 most popular items by purchase count, then list (in a table):
